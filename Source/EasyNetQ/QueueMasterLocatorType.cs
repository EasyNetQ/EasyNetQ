///     Represents a strategy used to control queue leaders distribution between nodes.

///     Every queue in RabbitMQ has a primary replica. That replica is called queue leader
///     (originally "queue master"). All queue operations go through the leader replica
///     first and then are replicated to followers (mirrors). This is necessary to guarantee
///     FIFO ordering of messages. To avoid some nodes in a cluster hosting the majority of
///     queue leader replicas and thus handling most of the load, queue leaders should be
///     reasonably evenly distributed across cluster nodes.
